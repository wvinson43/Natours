## Natours Tourist Destination

## Description

I created this project as a mockup for a travel agency startup considering how to automate some aspects of setting up tour packages for vacationers
It allows the user to browse through some fictional travel tours, book a fictional tour, hypothetically purchase a tour after booking and access booked and purchased tours.  Access points have been set up for admin and users. 

It is built with Express.js and Node.js.  CRUD operations are achieved via MongoDB and Mongoose.  SendGrid and Nodemailer handle emails, and Stripe is utilized for secure transactions.  It is deployed via Heroku.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run "npm install" in the terminal.  Please ensure you are in the correct directory you intend to use for the project.

## Usage: 

To use this application, run "npm start" in the terminal, open your browser and go to localhost:8080 to get the application running. This application is currently deployed on Heroku at https://natours-wvinson43.herokuapp.com/   

## Testing
There are currently no test suites for this application.  However, Postman could certainly be used to test it if needed.
